## About
I was curious if I could improve heartrate beat detection.

### Binary C Code
Required to keep the rate of execution high.
The algorithm is in `alg.c` in this repo, but its compiled by the `https://www.espruino.com/service/compiler` service.  Paste `alg.c` into the webIDE and upload to a file to get the binary yourself if that is your thing, the you would have to copy paste the output into the boot.js file.
## Settings
### Enable
Override the default Bangle.HRM event with this algorithm.
